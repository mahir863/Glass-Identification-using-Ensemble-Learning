# Glass Identification using Ensemble Learning

● At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence if it is correctly identified. A frequent casework requirement is the comparison of glass from a crime scene with glass particles found to be associated with a suspect. Such glass particles are often exceedingly small. It is important to identify and compare these small glass fragments 
that may be significant in a forensic context.

● K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the most successful data mining methods used in classification problems. By combining different classifiers through voting resulted in better performance than using single classifiers. 

● In this project, we have applied ensemble learning to help criminological investigators in identifying the glass type. It 
checks if integrating multiple models improves overall predictive performance and robustness compared to using a single model. 

● Ensemble methods work by aggregating the predictions or decisions of the individual models to make a final prediction. The basic idea is that by combining multiple models, the weaknesses or errors of one model can be compensated for by the strengths of others, resulting in a more accurate and stable prediction. 

● We have observed that by applying multiple models like Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbour, SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistics Regression, we have got the accuracy of 95.29% by Ensemble Voting.
